        INDEPENDENCE DAY!
    </h3>
    <h4>
        We celebrate Independence Day every year on15 August as a national holiday in India
         to commemorate the independence of the nation from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947.
          This was the day on which the provisions of the Indian Independence Act of 1947 came into 
          effect, which transferred legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent Assembly.
           Independence corresponded with India's partition, wherein British India had been divided 
           into the Dominions of India and Pakistan along religious lines.
